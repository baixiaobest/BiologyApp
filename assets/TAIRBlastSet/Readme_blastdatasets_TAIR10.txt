TAIR10_blastsets

The files found in this directory all contain sequences generated from the TAIR10 (Dec 2010) release. 

If you are looking for a small subset of sequences and don?t want to download/parse these larger files, you can retrieve specific subsets of sequences using the TAIR Bulk download tool:

Fasta files of the 3 and 5? UTRs of each gene (each number in parenthesis corresponds to a UTR exon):
TAIR10_3_utr_20101028
TAIR10_5_utr_20101028
 	
Fasta file of all BAC sequences:
TAIR10_bac_con_20101028
 	
Fasta files of all ?cDNA? sequences (defined as CDS+UTRs-introns)
Note that the first file contains all TAIR10 cDNA sequences while the second file contains only one sequence per locus, 
corresponding to the ?representative gene model? sequence. The representative gene model is defined as the model that codes 
for the longest CDS at each locus:
TAIR10_cdna_20101214
TAIR10_cdna_20110103_representative_gene_model

The files above were updated on April 16, 2012 to remove a handful of incorrect gene symbols and full names.  All other information remains the same.

TAIR10_cdna_20110103_representative_gene_model_updated


Fasta files of all ?CDS? sequences
Note that the first file contains all TAIR10 CDS sequences while the second file contains only one sequence per locus, 
corresponding to the ?representative gene model? sequence. The representative gene model is defined as the model that codes 
for the longest CDS at each locus:
TAIR10_cds_20101214
TAIR10_cds_20110103_representative_gene_model

The files above were updated on April 16, 2012 to remove a handful of incorrect gene symbols and full names.  All other information remains the same.

Fasta files containing upstream and downstream sequences corresponding to 500, 1000, and 3000 bp. Note that for each of 
these 3 lengths, two files are available, which differ in their starting position: either upstream/downstream of the very
first/last annotated nucleotide of the gene (regardless of UTR or coding); or upstream/downstream of the annotated 
start codon/end codon: 

TAIR10_downstream_1000_20101104
TAIR10_downstream_1000_translation_start_20101028
 	
TAIR10_downstream_3000_20101028

TAIR10_downstream_500_20101028
TAIR10_downstream_500_translation_start_20101028
 
TAIR10_upstream_1000_20101104
TAIR10_upstream_1000_translation_start_20101028

Fasta file containing all TAIR10 exons:
TAIR10_exon_20101028

Fasta file containing all intergenic regions (all regions between TAIR10 annotated genes)
TAIR10_intergenic_20101028

Fasta file containing all TAIR10 introns:
TAIR10_intron_20101028

Fasta files of all ?protein? sequences
Note that the first file contains all TAIR10 protein sequences while the second file contains only one sequence per locus, 
corresponding to the ?representative gene model? sequence. The representative gene model is defined as the model that codes 
for the longest CDS at each locus:
TAIR10_pep_20101214
TAIR10_pep_20110103_representative_gene_model

The files above were updated on April 16, 2012 to remove a handful of incorrect gene symbols and full names.  All other information remains the same.

Fasta files of all TAIR10 sequences (defined as UTR+CDS+introns)
Note that the first file contains all TAIR10 model sequences while the second file contains only one sequence per locus, 
corresponding to the ?representative gene model? sequence. The representative gene model is defined as the model that codes 
for the longest CDS at each locus:
TAIR10_seq_20101214
